	<div class="intro">
		<p>Welcome, and thank you for taking the time to view my biography.<br><br> I would like to share with you a bit about myself...<br><br>I am a tinkerer, a ponderer, and a foodie. I have a Masters in Information Science, a Bachelors in Legal Studies and Philosophy, and a few certifications (CCNA and CompTIA Security+).<br>Most importantly: I love puzzles and spend my days solving them.</p>
		
		<p>I currently work at Verizon.<br>We are launching a software robotics program. I am leading the development team and managing the operations within the accounting and external relations.<br> Infrastructure and security are currently our greatest obstacles, but we are progressing rapidly. <br>I will shortly be launching a framework for our developers to work within, and this will reduce the timeline to create new automations. As well, this will make the adaptation and management more streamlined.</p>

		<p>I previously worked for AT&T.<br>I was developing software robotics in their ordering and consulting division when I left. I started with them as a lineman, worked that position through my undergrad. After graduation, I moved into their engineering and then into consulting for them. I soon managed a team of twenty consultants, oversaw the implementation of Switched Ethernet services, and then launched their internal robotics program.</p>
